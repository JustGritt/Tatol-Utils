# Tatol-Utils

This is a collection of utilities that I have created for my own use (mainly for my Windows 10 machine) it might work on other platforms, but I have not tested it. They are designed to solve specific problems that I have encountered and are not intended to be general purpose utilities. However, if you find them useful, feel free to use them.
